        <H1>Soldier build </H1>
        <p>The Soldier archetype in New World Aeternum embodies the spirit of the frontline warrior, adept at both defending allies and delivering powerful strikes against foes. Equipped with a sword and shield for balanced defense and offense, and a hatchet for versatility, the Soldier is an ideal choice for those seeking to master the art of war. In the late game, Soldiers can pivot into either a tanking role with sword and shield paired with a hammer or a DPS-focused playstyle using the hatchet alongside a greataxe or hammer.</p>

         <h2>1:Reverse Stab</h2>

         <p>everse Stab is the hardest-hitting skill for the Sword and Shield. But the most useful thing in it is the passive ability, Tactician, which reset all your cooldowns for 25% (except the Reverse Stab itself) with a successful hit. Another passive, Unstoppable Stab, adds Grit to this skill and lets you skip some boss mechanics in dungeons. This applies multiple times with multiple enemies, so you can basically fully reset your cooldowns by attacking 4 enemies at once. Usually, this can be the core skill of the whole build:
        </p>
         <h2>2:Whirling Blade</h2>

         <p>Pretty nice AoE skill with high damage, useful in PvE for DPS builds. The quick animation and Grit make it also useful in mass PvP</p>

         <h2>3:Shield Bash</h2>
         <img src="https://cdn-elpgl.nitrocdn.com/olOujzcbwTsakYAoyzbnKLdSXucqNLbm/assets/images/optimized/rev-41708c5/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Shield-Bash-Skill-NWNEWS.INFO_.jpg" alt="Shield Bash">
          <p>In PvP, however, the short duration combined with the insanely long cooldown make this great to use when youre anticipating heavy damage, like a Hatchet rushing you with Berserk or other similar situations. Otherwise, it falls short as your opponent can just choose not to interact with you during this skill and, then, you have a long wait before it back up.</p>

        <h2>4:Defiant Stance</h2>
        <img src="https://cdn-elpgl.nitrocdn.com/olOujzcbwTsakYAoyzbnKLdSXucqNLbm/assets/images/optimized/rev-41708c5/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Defiant-Stance-Skill-NWNEWS.INFO_.jpg" alt="Defiant Stance">

          <h1>Hatchet</h1>
          <img src="https://cdn-elpgl.nitrocdn.com/olOujzcbwTsakYAoyzbnKLdSXucqNLbm/assets/images/optimized/rev-41708c5/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/New-World-Hatchet-PvE-Build-With-Rending-Throw-NWNEWS.INFO_.jpg" alt="PvE Build With Rending Throw">

          <h2>1:Berserk</h2>
          <img src="https://cdn-elpgl.nitrocdn.com/olOujzcbwTsakYAoyzbnKLdSXucqNLbm/assets/images/optimized/rev-41708c5/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/New-World-Hatchet-Berserk-Active-Skill-NWNEWS.INFO_.jpg" alt="Berserk">
          <p>Berserk activates a furious state that enhances your damage and grants healing over time, allowing you to sustain yourself in battle while delivering relentless attacks against your foes.</p>



          <h2>2:Feral Rush</h2>
          <img src="https://cdn-elpgl.nitrocdn.com/olOujzcbwTsakYAoyzbnKLdSXucqNLbm/assets/images/optimized/rev-41708c5/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/New-World-Hatchet-Feral-Rush-Active-Skill-NWNEWS.INFO_.jpg" alt="Feral Rush">
          <p>Feral Rush is the only actual gap closer the Hatchet has. It can be upgraded to root the enemies if you hit them in the back, which is pretty useful for PvP.</p>

          <h2>3: Rending Throw</h2>
          <img src="https://cdn-elpgl.nitrocdn.com/olOujzcbwTsakYAoyzbnKLdSXucqNLbm/assets/images/optimized/rev-41708c5/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/New-World-Hatchet-Rending-Throw-Active-Skill-NWNEWS.INFO_.jpg" alt=" Rending Throw">
          <p>Its really good against heavily armored characters or if youre playing against a boss or an elite monster.</p>

          <h2>1:Sword And Shield Tanking Build</h2>
          <img src="https://cdn-elpgl.nitrocdn.com/olOujzcbwTsakYAoyzbnKLdSXucqNLbm/assets/images/optimized/rev-41708c5/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Sword-And-Shield-Build-Variant-NWNEWS.INFO_.jpg" alt="Sword And Shield Tanking Build">
          <p>The basic attack is going to be started off with a heavy attack, two light attacks, then you could block and hit them with the Shield Rush. Next, use the Reverse Stab to refund your cooldowns if needed, or use Defiant Stance if its not on a cooldown.</p>
          
          <h2>2:Sword And Shield build with every skill in Defender Tree grabbed</h2>
          <img src="https://cdn-elpgl.nitrocdn.com/olOujzcbwTsakYAoyzbnKLdSXucqNLbm/assets/images/optimized/rev-41708c5/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Sword-And-Shield-Defensive-Build-NWNEWS.INFO_-1024x627.jpg" alt="Sword And Shield build with every skill in Defender Tree grabbed">
          <p>Of course, you can just grab every skill in Defender tree, for example, for solo bosses or PvP where you cannot fully realize the potential of Reverse Stab cooldown reduction or if you dont like to use it</p>
          

          <h2>3:Tanking build variant with Shield Bash</h2>
          <img src="https://cdn-elpgl.nitrocdn.com/olOujzcbwTsakYAoyzbnKLdSXucqNLbm/assets/images/optimized/rev-41708c5/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Sword-And-Shield-Build-With-Shield-Bash-NWNEWS.INFO_.jpg" alt="Tanking build variant with Shield Bash">
          <p>If you do want more crowd control and, more importantly, more taunt abilities, you can use this build with Shield Bash:</p>
          <p>Since this is a defensive build, it doesnt have haste or damage options. You can take One With The Shield or Concussive Bash instead of Final Blow.</p>
