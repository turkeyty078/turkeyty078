    <p>The Occultist Class in New World Aeternum The Occultist is a mystical and enigmatic class that harnesses the raw elemental power of the Fire Staff and Ice Gauntlet. Combining high burst damage from the Fire Staff with the control and damage-over-time abilities of the Ice Gauntlet, the Occultist is a fantastic choice for players seeking a more strategic, methodical playstyle. This class excels in both solo play and group content, making it a versatile and powerful option as you progress through Aeternum. Lets explore how the Occultist stands out in the early game and how it can seamlessly transition into late-game meta builds.</p>
     <h1>the Occultist build</h1>

     
          <h1>Fire Staff</h1>
<p>Use abilities on cooldown and chain with ice gauntlet abilities , if you want more mobility you can switch out fireball for burnout </p>

     <h2>1:Fireball</h2>
     <img src="https://cdn-elpgl.nitrocdn.com/olOujzcbwTsakYAoyzbnKLdSXucqNLbm/assets/images/optimized/rev-41708c5/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/New-World-Fireball-Skill-NWNEWS.INFO_.jpg" alt="Fireball">
     <p>The high impact damage and burning field make it great against one or many foes in terms of PvE, but the direct hit and the area damage do not double up. For PvP, the high burst potential of this skill makes it worth using. Add it to the fairly strong and long-lasting ground AoE and it doubles as a zoning tool.</p>

     <h2>2:FlameThrower</h2>
     <img src="https://cdn-elpgl.nitrocdn.com/olOujzcbwTsakYAoyzbnKLdSXucqNLbm/assets/images/optimized/rev-41708c5/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/New-World-FlameThrower-Skill-NWNEWS.INFO_.jpg" alt="FlameThrower">
     <p>When combined with Reheat, you can channel for over 6-seconds and activate Reheats mana regen. The regen will not be strong enough to fully offset the mana cost of Flamethrower. It is unique in the fact that it can backstab for guaranteed crits</p>
     <p>While it is not the most impressive skill for PvE, with the upgrades it has, it becomes a bit of a versatile skill for weaving in when other skills are on cooldown to maintain any Burn stacks. </p>

     <h2>3:Burn Out</h2>
     <img src="https://cdn-elpgl.nitrocdn.com/olOujzcbwTsakYAoyzbnKLdSXucqNLbm/assets/images/optimized/rev-41708c5/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/New-World-Burn-Out-Skill-NWNEWS.INFO_.jpg" alt="Burn Out">
     <p>Burn Out tends to mostly be used for Mobility and positioning, as if you charge at an enemy, they can block it, stopping you in your tracks because it goes in a straight line. Once you take Heat it Up!, you can steer the direction of the Ability. While dealing fairly decent damage, its not a particularly strong option. </p>
     <p>Despite being blockable, the mobility this provides makes it a must-have in almost any PvP build. Its not something youd ever really want to be without, as youre limited in mobility, and usually, your other weapon tends to be something to fill that melee range better.</p>




     <h1>ice gauntlet </h1>
     <p>he ice gauntlet had very strong cc and damage capabilities , use your ice wall to block enemies and drop ice storm on them for aoe damage, use your ice pilon off to the side for consistent damage or use it as a shield to take mobs agro if in dangerous situations </p>
     <img src="https://cdn-elpgl.nitrocdn.com/olOujzcbwTsakYAoyzbnKLdSXucqNLbm/assets/images/optimized/rev-41708c5/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/New-World-Ice-Gauntlet-Build-With-Ice-Pylon-NWNEWS.INFO_-1024x623.jpg" alt="Ice Gauntlet Build With Ice Pylon">
     


     <h2>1:Ice Storm</h2>
     <img src="https://cdn-elpgl.nitrocdn.com/olOujzcbwTsakYAoyzbnKLdSXucqNLbm/assets/images/optimized/rev-41708c5/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/New-World-Ice-Storm-NWNEWS.INFO_.jpg" alt="Ice Storm">
     <p>The main abilities are slow, stop and damage your enemies. The moment you cast Ice Storm, it doubles proc damage and the first value is always exactly 17% of weapon damage and then, the second value is around 15.5% of weapon damage.</p>
     <p>This is trickier to pull off in single-target PVP because it requires the enemy to stay within its radius, but its very useful for killing multiple enemies, especially in Expeditions.</p>





     <h2>2:Ice Pylon</h2>
     <img src="https://cdn-elpgl.nitrocdn.com/olOujzcbwTsakYAoyzbnKLdSXucqNLbm/assets/images/optimized/rev-41708c5/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/New-World-Ice-Pylon-NWNEWS.INFO_.jpg" alt="Ice Pylon">
     <p>It takes your crit chance and your damage modifiers, so if you have a 20% damage bonus from light armor, the Pylon will do that additional 20 damage as well.</p>
     <p>Pylon Dodge will only enhance the fire rate for two seconds, which allows for two fast shots Unfortunately, its easy to kill the Pylon in PvP. It can be powerful when paired with the right secondary weapon. Placing down Pylons that deal consistent damage means you can switch your attention to other matters, and rely on the Pylons to deal frost damage.</p>

     

     <h2>3:Ice Shower</h2>
     <img src="https://cdn-elpgl.nitrocdn.com/olOujzcbwTsakYAoyzbnKLdSXucqNLbm/assets/images/optimized/rev-41708c5/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/New-World-Ice-Shower.jpg" alt="Ice Shower">
     <p>Ice Shower is a powerful crowd control active ability for the Ice Gauntlet. It slows the enemy, roots them, and prevents them from either blocking or dodging while affected by the shower. The root only lasts for one second but the slowing and the dodge block will remain on the target for however long they remain in the Shower plus three seconds after they avoid the shower. The only ones who can dodge through this are tanks with Shield Rush.</p>
     <p>Ice Shower is an extremely powerful PVP ability, which has its uses for PVE and fighting large groups of enemies.</p>

<h1>Attribute Spreads for Occultist</h1>
     <h2>Glass Cannon Occultist (Max Damage for PvE and PvP):</h2>
     <p>Intelligence: 450-500</p>
     <p>Constitution: 50 </p>
     <p>his build maximizes your damage output, but youll need to rely on dodging and positioning to avoid damage. Its ideal for experienced players who prefer dealing as much damage as possible in shorter fights, where survivability isn't the main focus.</p>

    

         <h2>Balanced Occultist (PvE/PvP Mix)</h2>
         <p>Intelligence: 400</p>
         <p>Constitution: 100</p>
         <p>This build strikes a balance between damage and survivability. With 100 Constitution, youll have enough health to survive a few hits, making it suitable for most content in the game, whether its leveling, Expeditions, or PvP.</p>



         <h2>Tankier Occultist (For PvP ):</h2>
         <p>ntelligence: 350</p>
         <p>Constitution: 150</p>
         <p>or players who need to endure more damage in PvP or high-end PvE, this build sacrifices some damage for extra health and physical armor. Its ideal for Wars, Outpost Rush, and late-game Expeditions where survivability is critical.</p>




       <h2>Final Thoughts on Constitution Levels</h2>
       <p>50 Constitution is for those who want to go all-in on damage.</p>
       <p>100 Constitution offers a safer middle ground for most players.</p>
       <p>150 Constitution is the go-to choice if you need to be tankier, especially in PvP</p>


       <h1>Armor</h1>
       <p>armor recommendations, this class plays best with a LIGHT armor weight but medium also is viable for more survivability. </p>
