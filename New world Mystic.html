                  <p>This gives a player both the ability to heal and Empower sllies and Themselve,while also being able to punish those rushing you. A  great skill to support a tank.</p>
                  <p>note,it doesn't go away if you swap your weapon.</p>

                <p>This is a flexible build, suitable for melee party gameplay in dungeons, siege, warfare, and open-world raids. This build is very positional but rewards you with an insane level of raw healing. To decrease the cooldown of the Beacon using Refreshing Move perk is recommended.</p>



                     <h2>2:Mobile Life Staff Build</h2>
                     <img src="https://cdn-elpgl.nitrocdn.com/olOujzcbwTsakYAoyzbnKLdSXucqNLbm/assets/images/optimized/rev-41708c5/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/New-World-Mobile-Life-Staff-Build-NWNEWS.INFO_.jpg" alt="Mobile Life Staff Build">
                      <p>This build is highly mobile and suitable for ranged groups and roaming mid-scale PvP.</p>

                      <h2>3:Life Staff Orb Build</h2>
                      <img src="https://cdn-elpgl.nitrocdn.com/olOujzcbwTsakYAoyzbnKLdSXucqNLbm/assets/images/optimized/rev-41708c5/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/New-World-Life-Staff-Orb-Build-NWNEWS.INFO_.jpg" alt="Life Staff Orb Build">
                      <p>Orb build fits better paired with the Void Gauntlet, because you might get overhealed using Beacon.</p>

                      <h2>1:Void Gauntlet As A Supportive Weapon Build</h2>

                      <p>Essence Rupture combined with Oblivion gives players an ability to empower allies and themselves, gives superior Stamina and Health regeneration while also punishing enemies rushing you. This is a great combination to support a Tank. Also, this can be used in PvP, cast Oblivion, and hold the enemies in it by Petrifying Scream.
                        Note, both of these skills  Oblivion and Essence Rupture  dont go away if you swap your weapon. With Refreshing Precision, you can even reduce cooldowns of the other weapon abilities on critical hits standing in Oblivion.</p>

                          <h2>2:Void Gauntlet Ranged Sustain Build</h2>
                          <img src="https://cdn-elpgl.nitrocdn.com/olOujzcbwTsakYAoyzbnKLdSXucqNLbm/assets/images/optimized/rev-41708c5/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/New-World-Void-Gauntlet-Ranged-Sustain-Build-NWNEWS.INFO_.jpg" alt="Void Gauntlet Ranged Sustain Build">
                          <p>You might need some Focus points for it. With this build, it is possible to kite around your enemies using Orb of Decay and Essence Rupture to damage and heal at the same time, and cast Petrifying Scream if the enemies get too close.</p>
                          <p>You can take Mending Evasions instead of Refreshing Harvest, but it fits only for full Focus build, since 80% of weapon damage is not a high number.</p>

                          <h2>3:Void Gauntlet With A Full Annihilation Tree</h2>
                          <img src="https://cdn-elpgl.nitrocdn.com/olOujzcbwTsakYAoyzbnKLdSXucqNLbm/assets/images/optimized/rev-41708c5/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/New-World-Void-Gauntlet-With-A-Full-Annihilation-Tree-NWNEWS.INFO_.jpg" alt="Void Gauntlet With A Full Annihilation Tree">
                          <p>An easy-to-go build with a full Annihilation tree becomes more popular. While Glimpse of the Void elite fits better for melee build to reduce cooldowns with Void Blade hits, its in the Decay skill tree, where there are not so many useful passives</p>



                          <h2>4:Void Gauntlet Build With Glimpse of The Void</h2>
                          <img src="https://cdn-elpgl.nitrocdn.com/olOujzcbwTsakYAoyzbnKLdSXucqNLbm/assets/images/optimized/rev-41708c5/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/New-World-Void-Gauntlet-Build-With-Glimpse-of-The-Void-NWNEWS.INFO_.jpg" alt="">
                          <p>Melee build without Oblivion, but with Glimpse of the Void is also possible, but it fits for solo play only</p>
                          <p>Oblivion gives amazing utility, roughly said, it gives the same effect as Baleful Tether, but gives it immediately and for all your allies too.
                          In this build, you have a great mana regeneration with Efficient Harvest and Tethered Focus, great survivability, but you have to wait for Baleful Tether stacking and can give only Essence Rupture as a utility for your group. </p>
