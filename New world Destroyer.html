    <h1>The Destroyer build</h1>
    <p>The Destroyer class stands as a bruiser powerhouse in New World, wielding the Great Axe and War Hammer to dominate in PvP, especially in late-game content. With its heavy-hitting abilities, crowd control, and high sustain, the Destroyer excels in both offense and defense, making it an ideal choice for those looking to be the frontline force in Wars, Outpost Rush, and open-world skirmishes. However, while the Great Axe and War Hammer shine in PvP, PvE content may require a pivot to more meta-oriented builds, such as Spear or Greatsword, for improved versatility and consistent damage output.</p>

    <h2>Great Axe</h2>

 <h2>1:Reap</h2>

 <p>This ability allows you to pull one enemy out of a position quickly, isolating them or grouping several enemies together for easy follow-up from any number of other AoE skills in both PvE and PvP. Foes can Dodge Roll out of the pull, so in PvP scenarios, you will want to use this to either bait out a Dodge or movement skill or punish those who have neither ready. </p>


<h2>2:Maelstrom</h2>
<img src="https://cdn-elpgl.nitrocdn.com/olOujzcbwTsakYAoyzbnKLdSXucqNLbm/assets/images/optimized/rev-41708c5/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/New-World-Great-Axe-Maelstrom-Active-Skill-NWNEWS.INFO_.jpg" alt="Maelstrom">
<p>This sweeping attack gets an extra swing with Masteries and can destroy incoming projectiles. The fact that it can hit in a 360-degree arc around the player does feel good, and the two attacks are rather quick; however, it does not have the crowd control power of Gravity Well or the healing of Reap</p>
<p>This Skill AoEs in a very wide area and hits twice when upgraded. It works best on Gravity Welled enemies, but you want to use it whenever its off cooldown when facing multiple enemies. </p>

<h2>3:Gravity Well</h2>
<img src="https://cdn-elpgl.nitrocdn.com/olOujzcbwTsakYAoyzbnKLdSXucqNLbm/assets/images/optimized/rev-41708c5/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/New-World-Great-Axe-Gravity-Well-Active-Skill-NWNEWS.INFO_.jpg" alt="Gravity Well">
<p>This is a pretty niche passive and generally only works well with Gravity, also being taken. Without Gravity, this is pretty lackluster, in general. As a rule, Heavy Attacks will provide less overall damage, as you wont stack your damage bonuses that require multiple hits nearly as fast. Even after the passives are stacked, theyre still easier to maintain with Light Attacks. This tends to be overrated, as it previously had a bug that made your heavy attacks hit twice. </p>

<h2>1:Shockwave</h2>

<p>t is important to note that Stun in New World will be broken on taking damage, so make sure you follow up this Ability with a big hit. This Ability is also somewhat telegraphed, making it easy to be dodged in PvP.
 The AoE stun and taunt make it great for what you want to do as a tank. The same Stun can also give it quite a bit of impact in PvP. Add in the utility of the upgrades and its great in situations where you get outnumbered.</p>


<h2>2:Clear Out</h2>
<img src="https://cdn-elpgl.nitrocdn.com/olOujzcbwTsakYAoyzbnKLdSXucqNLbm/assets/images/optimized/rev-41708c5/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/New-World-Clear-Out-NWNEWS.INFO_.jpg" alt="Clear Out">
<p>This Ability is fast and hits several foes in front of you; however, displacing foes in a group is typically more bad than good for your group. This really only has some slight niche use in Wars to knock people off capture points. Beyond that, it doesnâ€™t offer much in terms of damage or decent utility.</p>





<h2>3:Armor Breaker</h2>
<img src="https://cdn-elpgl.nitrocdn.com/olOujzcbwTsakYAoyzbnKLdSXucqNLbm/assets/images/optimized/rev-41708c5/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/New-World-Armor-Breaker-NWNEWS.INFO_.jpg" alt="Armor Breaker">
<p>This Ability is fast, making it a good follow-up to Basic Attacks. In PvP, this is extremely difficult to avoid if executed at melee range. However, the short-range of the ability makes it harder to use properly.
 Being high single target damage with armor penetration makes it excellent for holding boss aggro if you decide to tank with the War Hammer or use it as a supporting weapon. </p>
