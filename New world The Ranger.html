                <h1>The Ranger</h1>
                <p>The Ranger class in New World Aeternum is a fan favorite, especially for new players venturing into the vast open world of Aeternum. Its versatility and ease of use make it an excellent starting class for questing and exploring. Lets dive into why this class shines in the early stages of the game and how it sets you up for success before transitioning to more meta builds for late-game content.</p>
                <h1>Bow Skill Tree</h1>
                <img src="https://cdn-elpgl.nitrocdn.com/olOujzcbwTsakYAoyzbnKLdSXucqNLbm/assets/images/optimized/rev-41708c5/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/New-World-Bow-Mobile-Build-NWNEWS.INFO_-1024x630.jpg" alt="bow">

                <h2>1:Rain of Arrows</h2>
                <img src="https://cdn-elpgl.nitrocdn.com/olOujzcbwTsakYAoyzbnKLdSXucqNLbm/assets/images/optimized/rev-41708c5/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/New-World-Rain-of-Arrow-NWNEWS.INFO_.jpg" alt="Rain of Arrows">
                <p>Both Rain of Arrows and Poison Shot are great for providing DPS support at the range, while your close-range brawlers are fighting it out on the front line. Rain of Arrows is much wider, however, which makes aiming with it more forgiving.</p>

                <h2>2:Evade Shot</h2>
                <img src="https://cdn-elpgl.nitrocdn.com/olOujzcbwTsakYAoyzbnKLdSXucqNLbm/assets/images/optimized/rev-41708c5/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/New-World-Evade-Shot-Skill-NWNEWS.INFO_.jpg" alt="Evade Shot">
                <p>With Evade Shot adding knockback and Go the Distance adding Haste, this skill is really great for keeping distance with foes in both PvE and PvP.</p>

                <h2>3:Penetrating Shot</h2>
                <img src="https://cdn-elpgl.nitrocdn.com/olOujzcbwTsakYAoyzbnKLdSXucqNLbm/assets/images/optimized/rev-41708c5/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/New-World-Penetrating-Shot-Skill-NWNEWS.INFO_.jpg" alt="Penetrating Shot">
                <p>When used directly after a bow light or heavy attack, the burst potential quickly becomes apparent. With the ability having 150% weapon damage scaling while being on a single attribute scaling weapon, Penetrating Shot is one of the hardest hitting abilities in the game.</p>


                <h2>Mobility and Defense oriented Spear build</h2>
                <img src="https://cdn-elpgl.nitrocdn.com/olOujzcbwTsakYAoyzbnKLdSXucqNLbm/assets/images/optimized/rev-41708c5/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/New-World-Mobility-and-Defense-oriented-Spear-build-NWNEWS.INFO_.jpg" alt="Mobility and Defense oriented Spear build">
                <p>e usage of Refreshing Precision and Deadly Distance in PvP is pretty hard, but you can use this option if you feel confident with it. Unerring Precision is also optional, you can take any other passive you like.

                    As for rotation, its possible to stunlock your opponent in PvE with this build. The rotation is pretty simple: Sweep, two light attacks, dodge, Vault Kick, two light attacks, dodge, Sweep, and again.</p>


                    <h2>1:Javelin</h2>
                    <img src="https://cdn-elpgl.nitrocdn.com/olOujzcbwTsakYAoyzbnKLdSXucqNLbm/assets/images/optimized/rev-41708c5/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/New-World-Javelin-Skill-NWNEWS.INFO_.jpg" alt="Javelin">
                    <p>This Skill is excellent at attacking and knocking down enemies that are hitting you from range. It can be decent as a finishing option for someone attempting to run away. 
                        Being one of the few high damage ratios on the Spear, this ability can really hurt with practice and getting those headshots. It will take a while to build that consistency, but it can be worth it once upgraded</p>

                       <h2>2:Sweep</h2>
                        <img src="https://cdn-elpgl.nitrocdn.com/olOujzcbwTsakYAoyzbnKLdSXucqNLbm/assets/images/optimized/rev-41708c5/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/New-World-Sweep-Skill-NWNEWS.INFO_.jpg" alt="">
                        <p>This crowd control move feels pretty fast and consistent; however, the Mastery Coup de Gr√¢ce is not that great because this is basically the same damage as a Heavy attack.
                            When activated, Sweep will knock your enemys legs out from underneath them, disabling them for a short period. This is very effective in PvP.</p>

                       <h2>3:Vault Kick</h2>
                       <img src="https://cdn-elpgl.nitrocdn.com/olOujzcbwTsakYAoyzbnKLdSXucqNLbm/assets/images/optimized/rev-41708c5/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/New-World-Vault-Kick-Skill-NWNEWS.INFO_.jpg" alt="Vault Kick">
                       <p>This crowd control move is pretty great because it moves you forward and can Stun through Grit. In PvE this skill leaves a lot to be desired due to the narrow range that it hits compared to Sweeps knockdown.
                        In PvP, this skill functions as both a Stun and a small gap closer. The most useful thing in this ability is its passive Continuous Motion which decreases cooldowns greatly and is a core of many builds.</p>
