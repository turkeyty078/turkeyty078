    <h1>Musketeer build</h1>
    <p>The Musketeer class in New World is an excellent choice for players seeking precision and finesse, blending the long-range firepower of the musket with the elegant and deadly close-quarters combat of the rapier. This combination shines in both solo and group play, making it ideal for players looking to thrive in Aeternum's open-world and questing scenarios. Lets explore why the Musketeer is a top-tier starter class and how it transitions into more potent builds for late-game content.</p>
    <h2>Rapier skill tree</h2>

    <p>The last passive skill of Tondo is pretty hard to use since it works if youre more than 4 meters away from your enemy, while the range of Tondo is actually 5-6 meters. To finalize, the final passive of the Flurry tree is also pretty arguable. So you can take 3 passives from the Grace skill tree or simply pick up all skills in the Blood skill tree since theres no reason to waste skill points on a rather useless first passive ability in the Grace tree just to pick up Perfectionist.</p>



    <h2>Tondo</h2>
    <img src="https://cdn-elpgl.nitrocdn.com/olOujzcbwTsakYAoyzbnKLdSXucqNLbm/assets/images/optimized/rev-41708c5/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/New-World-Tondo-Skill-NWNEWS.INFO_.jpg" alt="Tondo">
    <p>The range doesnt change with Proper Spacing ability. The Bleed can be extended through passives and has a maximum duration of 20 seconds.
     In PvP, it can be used for 50v50 Wars, as it can apply to many targets at once with good spacing. For PvE, it can be also applied to many targets and can be your primary AoE option</p>



  <h2>Flourish And Finish</h2>
  <img src="https://cdn-elpgl.nitrocdn.com/olOujzcbwTsakYAoyzbnKLdSXucqNLbm/assets/images/optimized/rev-41708c5/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/New-World-Flourish-And-Finish-Skill-NWNEWS.INFO_.jpg" alt="Flourish And Finish">
  <p>The Ability pairs together with Tondo to create a Bleed-stacking playstyle.Tondos bleed does 85% weapon damage over 12 seconds and, with Bloody End, you can consume it to do 150% of the Bleeds damage instantly</p>


  <h2>Flurry</h2>
  <img src="https://cdn-elpgl.nitrocdn.com/olOujzcbwTsakYAoyzbnKLdSXucqNLbm/assets/images/optimized/rev-41708c5/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/New-World-Flurry-NWNEWS.INFO_.jpg" alt="Flurry">
  <p>Each of Flurrys strikes deals 46%, 52%, 56%, 62%, and 82% weapon damage for a total of 298% weapon damage. Since each attack of Flurry is considered a Light Attack, this gives it a lot of synergies with Perks, like Enchanted and Refreshing Move. For Anything PvE, Flurry does incredibly high damage, and with certain passives, can reset itself entirely or almost entirely, making it highly spammable. </p>


<h2>Musket Sniper Build</h2>

<h2>1:Power Shot</h2>

<p>Also could be used as an opening ability combined with other modifiers for extremely huge headshots</p>


<h2>2:Powder Burn</h2>
<img src="https://cdn-elpgl.nitrocdn.com/olOujzcbwTsakYAoyzbnKLdSXucqNLbm/assets/images/optimized/rev-41708c5/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/New-World-Powder-Burn-Skill-NWNEWS.INFO_.jpg" alt="Powder Burn">
<p>This Skill is your opener to set a pretty strong DoT on the target thats based on your Weapons damage. </p>
<p>When combined with the initial shot damage, this ability will do a grand total of 290% weapon damage over 9 seconds. </p>
<p>If you utilize a Powder Burn into another Powder Burn before the burn ticks fall off, you will not do two ticks of burn damage at once  it will reset the burn stacks to 9 seconds</p>



<h2>3:Shooters Stance</h2>
<img src="https://cdn-elpgl.nitrocdn.com/olOujzcbwTsakYAoyzbnKLdSXucqNLbm/assets/images/optimized/rev-41708c5/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/New-World-Shooters-Stance-Skill-NWNEWS.INFO_.jpg" alt="Shooters Stance">
<P>You can only activate this Ability after reloading and have an additional, non-Shooter Stance, shot after the Stance ends</P>
<p>You can enter and exit the Stance whenever you want by pressing sprint, the ability key, dodge, Esc, or releasing RMB, and the ability will not go on cooldown unless youve shot at least one shot. Once the first shot is fired, the moment you exit the Stance, the Ability will go on cooldown</p>

<h1>Attribute Points for Musketeer</h1>
<p>he Musketeer class in New World thrives on a balanced attribute distribution that maximizes the damage output of both the musket and rapier. While the rapier traditionally scales better with Dexterity, Intelligence breakpoints offer greater overall bonuses to both weapons, making a high-Intelligence build optimal for late-game PvE. Here's a breakdown of recommended attribute points as you progress through the game.</p>

<h2>Early Game (Level 1-20)</h2>
<p>Dexterity (Dex): 100-150</p>
<p>Intelligence (Int): 50-100</p>
<p>Constitution (Con): 50</p>

<h2>Mid Game (Level 30-50)</h2>
<p>Dexterity (Dex): 200-250</p>
<p>Intelligence (Int): 150-200</p>
<p>Constitution (Con): 50-100</p>

<h2>Late Game (Level 60-65)</h2>
<p>Intelligence (Int): 350</p>
<p>Dexterity (Dex): 250</p>
<p>Constitution (Con): 5</p>
<p>With only 5 points in Constitution, this build offers little to no survivability, meaning its best suited for high-damage roles where you rely on mobility and positioning rather than health. The 350 Int / 250 Dex / 5 Con distribution ensures you're dealing immense damage at the cost of being more vulnerable to mistakes.</p>

<h1>Armor</h1>
<p>this class plays best with a LIGHT armor weight but medium also is viable for more survivability. </p>


<h1>Trade Skills</h1>
<p>Engineering, Logging, Woodworking</p>
